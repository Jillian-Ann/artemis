## Artemis

Artemis is a podcast streaming and recommendation app created by [Soheila Bayat](https://github.com/Soheila-Bayat), [Funmi Ojo](https://github.com/FunmiOjo), [Jillian McLaren](https://github.com/Jillian-Ann) and [Jasmine English](https://github.com/jcenglish).  It is available at [ArtemisPlayer.com](www.artemisplayer.com).

We built Artemis using React and Redux on the frontend and Node.js, Postgres, Sequelize and Express on the backend. We sourced the podcast data from the [ListenNotes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/), which gave us access to information on over 550,000 podcasts.
